# snapscan
A NodeJS wrapper for the SnapScan API.

## Disclaimer & Things to know
I am not affiliated with [SnapScan](http://www.getsnapscan.com/) by any means and this is not an official API wrapper, but it is pretty cool.

This module uses some newer Javascript syntax, so it currently only supports node v4+. If someone really wants support for something below that, let me know and we can take a look at adding support for that.

The module can also technically work browser or server-side, but I would recommend using it server-side if possible since you will be passing in your `apiKey` and `merchant` name.

All methods return [Javascript Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) with JSON objects as return data.

## Installation

For the `npm` okes
```
npm install --save snapscan
```

or using `yarn`
```
yarn add snapscan
```

## Usage
```
const SnapScan = require('snapscan')

const snapscan = new SnapScan({
  apiKey: '<your_api_key>',
  merchant: '<your_merchant_name>'
})

// Example method you can use to get your SnapCode/QR Code link and image
snapscan.getQRCode()
  .then((snapCode) => {
    console.log(snapCode)
    // logs object containing `urlLink` and `imageLink`
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    // logs error thrown if anything failed
  })
```

## Supported Methods

Take a look at the [official SnapScan API documentation](http://developer.getsnapscan.com/) for all possible endpoints and parameters. Everything is supported in this API Wrapper.

### getQRCode()
#### Description
Used to generate your SnapCode/QR Code to display on a website, etc.

#### Parameters
All parameters are optional.
* `snapCode` - If you want to generate a SnapCode other than for your given merchant account
* `id` - Specify additional reference that is unique to the SnapCode. Will be associated to `merchantReference` in payments
* `amount` - Pre-populate owed amount
* `strict` - {true/false} Set to `true` to prevent customer from paying the same reference (`id`) twice or to edit the payment amount
* `snapCodeType` - The image file type to return. Either `svg` or `png` (Defaults to `svg`)
* `snapCodeSize` - The size of the image - between 50 and 500 (Defaults to 125)

#### Example
```
snapscan.getQRCode({
  id: 'order 51',
  amount: 250,
  strict: true,
  snapCodeType: 'png',
  snapCodeSize: 300
})
  .then((snapCode) => {
    console.log(snapCode)
    // logs object containing `urlLink` and `imageLink`
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    // logs error thrown if anything failed
  })
```

### getPayments()
#### Description
The APIâ€™s main purpose is to provide you with various ways to query the status of payments that were made against your merchant account.

#### Parameters
All parameters are optional.
* `startDate` - Payments that were started at or after this time, eg: `'2000-01-01T01:00:00Z'`
* `endDate` - Payments that were started before this time, eg: `'2000-01-01T01:00:00Z'`
* `status` - A comma separated string of the following values: `completed`, `error` or `pending`, eg. `'completed,pending'`
* `snapCode` - Payments with the SnapCode.
* `snapCodeReference` - Payments with the SnapCode reference.
* `userReference` - Payments with the user reference.
* `merchantReference` - Payments with your reference.
* `statementReference` - Payments included in the settlement with the provided reference.

#### Example
```
snapscan.getPayments({
  startDate: '2000-01-01T01:00:00Z',
  status: 'completed,pending'
})
  .then((payments) => {
    console.log(payments)
    // logs array of payment objects
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    // logs error thrown if anything failed
  })
```

### getPayment()
#### Description
Returns a single payment.

#### Parameters
This method only takes one required argument, namely the payment `id`

#### Example
```
snapscan.getPayment(123)
  .then((payment) => {
    console.log(payment)
    // logs payment object
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    // logs error thrown if anything failed
  })
```

### getCashUpPayments()
#### Description
Returns all payments that were completed successfully in the specified cash up period. If a cash up period contains any pending payments, the promise will reject. A cash up period is considered complete once the SnapScan guys know the status of all the payments within the period. See [Cash Ups](http://developer.getsnapscan.com/#cash-ups) for more details.

#### Parameters
This method only takes one required argument, namely the cash up period's `reference`

#### Example
```
snapscan.getCashUpPayments('1e07ac748d2627ba')
  .then((payments) => {
    console.log(payments)
    // logs array of payment object
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    // logs error thrown if anything failed
  })
```

### cashUp()
#### Description
The cash up API allows you to mark the end of your transaction period on the SnapScan system. Once a transaction period has been marked you will be able to query all payments that were completed within the associated period.

This method returns a reference that marks the end of the current transaction period and the start of a new one. The reference can be used to retrieve all the payments that were successfully completed in the associated period (using the getCashUpPayments() method above).

#### Parameters
This method takes no parameters

#### Example
```
snapscan.cashUp(')
  .then((cashUp) => {
    console.log(cashUp)
    // logs the cashUp object containing the `date` and `reference`
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    // logs error thrown if anything failed
  })
```

### getCashUps()
#### Description
Returns a paginated list of all cash up references that have been created. The references are ordered by descending date.

#### Parameters
This method takes no parameters

#### Example
```
snapscan.getCashUps(')
  .then((cashUps) => {
    console.log(cashUps)
    // logs array of cashUp objects
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    // logs error thrown if anything failed
  })
```
